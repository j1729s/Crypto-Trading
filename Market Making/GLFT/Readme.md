Guéant–Lehalle–Fernandez-Tapia Market Making Model

This model represents an advanced evolution of the well-known Avellaneda-Stoikov model and provides a closed-form approximation of asymptotic behavior for terminal time T. Simply, this model does not specify a terminal time, which makes it suitable for typical stocks, spot assets, or crypto perpetual contracts. By employing this model, it is anticipated that the half spread and skew will be accurately adjusted according to market conditions.
