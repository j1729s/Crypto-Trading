# Crypto-Trading

This contains templates of various trading strategies that are my IP and have been tried live. 

Jupyter files contains my analysis on Order Flow Imbalance, Trade Imbalance, and other predictors of mid price change. Some are backtests for taker strategies same goes for 'Tardis Data' folder. I had to redo it because I noticed discrepancies in the data I was collecting. I was eventually able to solve that. So didn't need tardis again!

The 'Live' folder contains some mm strategies I tried about a year ago at the very start of my trading journey on Binance.

The 'Market Making' folder contains templates for mm strategies that I tried on OKx. But my client got a better deal from ByBit.

The 'ByBit' folder contains my work on ByBit. The templates have not been uploaded yet. Because it is a work in progress. I'd like to make both my maker and my taker strategies as profutable as can before I add in a template. Although, some Rust helper libraries will be added from time to time.
